**ECSE 223 - ClimbSafe**

Project description:

You will create the ClimbSafe application for the small Himalayan country of Neptan. ClimbSafe must be 
used by any potential visitor to the mountains of Neptan to register as a member of ClimbSafe and to 
book mountain guides, equipment, and hotels for any mountain climb.

The ClimbSafe application has a built-in user account for the administrator of the Neptan Mountain 
Climbing (NMC) program called admin@nmc.nt. Initially, the password for this account is set to admin, 
but this can be changed later on. Only the administrator may define the start and end date of the 
climbing season. Each year, there are only a few weeks which allow for safe climb ing in the Neptan 
mountains. Each year, these climbing weeks are numbered starting with 1 and the members are assigned 
their climbing weeks using these numbers (i.e., either earlier or later in the climbing season).
The administrator also specifies the equipment available for rent (e.g., rope, pickaxe, portable stove, 
etc.). The weight of each piece of equipment is entered because all equipment must be carried to and 
from the mountains. However, since there is always enough equipment available for all members, the 
exact inventory is not tracked for any equipment by ClimbSafe. Furthermore, the administrator defines 
named bundles, i.e., sets of commonly needed equipment (at least two different kinds of equipment), 
which can be rented with a percentage discount if a mountain guide is also hired. If a mountain guide is 
not hired, an equipment bundle is rented at the regular price per week (i.e., the sum of the individual 
prices of the equipment in the bundle). Last but not least, the administrator also enters the information 
about hotels (name, address, and class from one to five stars), which are assigned to any member
wishing to stay three days before and after their mountain climb.
Each mountain guide registers in the system, providing their email address, name, and emergency 
contact (i.e., a phone number). The email address is used as the account name, which together with the 
guideâ€™s password identifies the guide in the system. Once entered, the email address cannot be changed.
Each mountain guide commits to being available for the whole climbing season. The weekly cost of a 
mountain guide is regulated by the NMC program and specified by the administrator. When a member 
registers in the system, they also provide an email address, name, and emergency contact. As is the case 
for mountain guides, the email address is used as the account name and cannot be changed. The account 
name and password identify each member. A member then indicates for how many weeks they wish to 
climb the Neptan mountains. In addition, a member indicates whether they wish to hire a mountain 
guide, selects any equipment and/or bundles they may wish to rent (e.g., one portable stove, two 
pickaxes, two bundles #1), and indicates whether they want to stay before and after their mountain 
climb. The total cost for the mountain guide and equipment is shown to the member. The hotel stay is 
provided free of charge. Note that the Neptan currency of shillings does not have any cents.
At some point before the start of the climbing season, the administrator initiates the assignment of 
guides, climbing weeks, and hotels to members, so that the total costs for guide and equipment can be 
shown to the member. More information about the assignment process will be provided at a later point.
At the end of the climbing season, all members and guides are removed from the ClimbSafe application.
